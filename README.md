# Introduction
**This contains the lesson plan for an instructor led course for Spring Boot.**

Venmo, Paypal, Splitwise, and more are making it easier than ever to split up group expenses. 
In this short course, we will develop a simple backend for our very own shared expenses app.
To do this we will build a small web service with **Spring Boot** and explore two core principles of web development: CRUD and REST.
